    "We call these fundamental data structures because they exist in most programming languages and it's hard to write any program without using at least one of these. The reason why there are so many data structures is that each of them is specific to certain types of data manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We implement all of these data structures using classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, Python lists are implemented in the C programming language using arrays. An array is a fixed-length chunk of memory that allows you to access each position in constant time. So the list [5, 3, 8] will be stored in an array where the first value is 5, the second is 3 and the third is 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to implement lists using a linked structure. This means that the list [5, 3, 8] will be stored using three objects. Each of these objects will store the value plus references (links) to the neighboring elements.\n",

For example, to reach the third element in the linked structure, we need to start at 5 and follow the links from 5 to 3 and then from 3 to 8. Because of its linked structure, we call this data structure a linked list.\n",
