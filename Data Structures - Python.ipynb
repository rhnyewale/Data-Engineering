    "We call these fundamental data structures because they exist in most programming languages and it's hard to write any program without using at least one of these. The reason why there are so many data structures is that each of them is specific to certain types of data manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We implement all of these data structures using classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, Python lists are implemented in the C programming language using arrays. An array is a fixed-length chunk of memory that allows you to access each position in constant time. So the list [5, 3, 8] will be stored in an array where the first value is 5, the second is 3 and the third is 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to implement lists using a linked structure. This means that the list [5, 3, 8] will be stored using three objects. Each of these objects will store the value plus references (links) to the neighboring elements.\n",

For example, to reach the third element in the linked structure, we need to start at 5 and follow the links from 5 to 3 and then from 3 to 8. Because of its linked structure, we call this data structure a linked list.\n",

    "We've implemented our first list data structure. We can now add data to our list and iterate over all of the data it contains.\n",

    "When compared to Python lists, this might not seem like much. For example, we can't access an element from its index given its position on the list. We could implement a method to do it, but it would require us to traverse the list making it a O(N) operation, where N is the length of the list. By contrast, Python lists can do this in constant time.\n",

    "However, linked lists have advantages over array-based implementations. For example, we can append values in constant time. In contrast, as we insert elements in a Python list, since the array is a fixed-length data structure, this array needs to grow. Every time this happens, the whole list needs to be recreated. This means that appending to a Python list has O(N) complexity or O(1) amortized complexity.\n",

    "Another thing that we can do with a linked list is to prepend elements in constant time — that is, adding an element to the start of the list. Here's an animation describing the step for doing this:\n",
