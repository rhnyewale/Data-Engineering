# Data-Engineering
To learn strategies to deal with petabytes of data, automating intensive queries, and understanding the architecture of a robust data platform. All the tools, algorithms, and design of a data engineer's role will teach you to become an indispensable member of a data team, and can even help  us with our own data needs.

A data engineer's responsibility is to build the architecture for a data platform that enables data analysts, scientists, and other curious types to query their data without worry. Essentially, a data engineer needs to have the skills to build a data pipeline that connects all the pieces of the data ecosystem together and keep it up and running.

**Data engineering** is the first — and arguably most crucial — step for a successful data strategy. Data engineers make sure data scientists have the data they need to perform data science. They're responsible for:

* Accessing, collecting, auditing, and cleaning data from applications and systems into a usable state
* Creating and maintaining efficient databases
* Building data pipelines
* Monitoring and managing systems, including distributed systems
