To learn strategies to deal with petabytes of data, automating intensive queries, and understanding the architecture of a robust data platform. All the tools, algorithms, and design of a data engineer's role will teach you to become an indispensable member of a data team, and can even help  us with our own data needs.

A data engineer's responsibility is to build the architecture for a data platform that enables data analysts, scientists, and other curious types to query their data without worry. Essentially, a data engineer needs to have the skills to build a data pipeline that connects all the pieces of the data ecosystem together and keep it up and running.

**Data engineering** is the first — and arguably most crucial — step for a successful data strategy. Data engineers make sure data scientists have the data they need to perform data science. They're responsible for:

* Accessing, collecting, auditing, and cleaning data from applications and systems into a usable state
* Creating and maintaining efficient databases
* Building data pipelines
* Monitoring and managing systems, including distributed systems

To emphasize just how important data engineering is for data science, take a look at the following hierarchy of needs:

Data engineers are responsible for the bottom two rows and also play a big role in the third row from the bottom.

Data engineers' and data scientists' skills have some overlap at the boundaries of each role's knowledge, but they specialize in different things. For instance, given that data engineers are software engineers who work with data technologies, programming is the largest part of their training and workload, whereas data scientists ideally only program for analysis and predictions.
