    "We learned about different data structures, such as **lists** and **dictionaries**.

In this course, we will develop a data structure that has both fast search and efficient updates.\n",

    "Unfortunately, we are at a crossroads now where developing this new data structure requires a new way of thinking. This type of thinking is called **recursion**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion commonly refers to a function that calls itself. This backward way of thinking takes some time to sink in, but you'll soon notice that many algorithms and structures you come up with are naturally defined this way. Recursion doesn't just happen in programming though — there are examples of it even in art!\n",

    "\n",
    "In practice, we don't want our algorithms to keep going on forever. To stop recursion from continuing to infinity, we need to have some **base case** that makes sure it eventually stops. When we use recursion, we express the problem we want to solve as simpler instances of the same problem. The recursion comes from the fact that we use the same algorithm to solve those simpler instances. The base case happens when the problem becomes simple enough that we don't need to break it down further to solve it.\n",
