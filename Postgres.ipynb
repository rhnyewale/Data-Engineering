    "The goal of the data engineer is to unlock an organization's data ecosystem to a wide group of analysts, data scientists, or any other interested member. Sure, we could share the SQLite file around to every interested user, but what if there were 10,000 people interested in the data? SQLite does not scale well for that use case so we require a better choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "To serve such a vast amount of users, we would be better off using another database engine. In this course we'll use an open source relational database management system (RDBMS) called **Postgres**. Postgres is a much more robust engine that is implemented as a server rather than a single file. As a server, Postgres accepts connections from clients who can run queries like a **SELECT, INSERT**, or any other type of SQL query making the data accessible to a wide range of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this model, Postgres can handle multiple connections to the database solving one of the main data engineering challenges."
